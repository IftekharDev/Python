Introduction to Python


Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. 
It is used as a support language for software developers. Python ranks among the most popular and fastest-growing languages in the world.
World's biggest app "Instagram" uses Python on its backend. Uber also uses Python somewhere as its backend language.


Python is popular because:
1. Emphasis is on code readability, shorter codes, and ease of writing.
2. Closer to the English language and easy to Learn.
3. Inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
4. Logical concepts are expressed in fewer lines of code in comparison to other languages such as C++ or Java.


Python is an interpreted language and a python interpreter is a program that knows how to execute a python code, it converts the code written 
in Python into a language that our computer can understand.


# Uses:
1. It is used to build web applications.
2. It provides GUI library to develop a user interface, ex - Tkinter, PyQt, etc.
3. It is used in software development.
4. It is used in Business Applications, ex- E-commerce.
5. Image Processing Applications.
6. Game Development.
7. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.


# Features :
1. It is a case-sensitive language.
2. Indentations are used.
3. Variables are used without declaration.
4. It is a dynamically typed language.
5. It consists of a large library, etc.


# IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) Python-
It is a code editor which allows the user to write and execute a python program.
It provides two window options:


1. Interpreter Window: It allows us to enter commands directly into python. On pressing enter, python will execute it and display the result.
(Print function is not required)


2. Program Window: This window is purely for commands to be given. Programs are written , comments can be given and print statement is used to
obtain result/output.
